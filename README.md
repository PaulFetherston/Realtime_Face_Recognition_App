# Realtime_Face_Recognition_App
Final Year Software Development Project

The project consists of an application, that uses facial recognition to detect if a known person to the system has the relevant security clearance to be in certain designated locations. A database is kept of known people and their security clearance on the system.

If a person without the correct security clearance is detected in a location, there information is displayed on a table for security. This table consists of the time, date and information on the individual.

When an unknown person is detected in any area their facial encodings are recorded and stored. This allows the system to detect if an unknown person is detected in more than one area. This unknown person is also displayed in a table showing which locations they were detected in along with the time. This makes it a lot easier for security to review CCTV footage. 

The aim of this project is to complement CCTV surveillance within a building. This will aid the security team in maintaining a high level of security especially in buildings with a high volume of personnel passing through. With over 10 yearsâ€™ experience in the security industry I have found that the topic of live video facial analytics is fascinating to me. I have witnessed huge developments in the area of CCTV and believe that the industry is very close to being able to commercially produce a quality product that can achieve what was set out in this project. 

Having no formal training in the Python programming language I wanted to show my ability to learn a new language while working on a project that complements my experience in the security industry.
